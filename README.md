# Razzer: Finding kernel race bugs through fuzzing

# Environment setup

```
$ source scripts/envsetup.sh
```

`scripts/envsetup.sh` sets up necessary environment variables. One
should select the kernel version during environment setup, for
example, `v4.17`.

# Install

## Initialize kernels_repo submodule

Kernel source codes used in this project are in the other reprository
which is included as a submodule. To initialize the submodule one
should execute `git submodule update` command as a follow.

```
$ git submodule update --init --depth=1 kernels_repo
```


## Dependencies

```
$ sudo apt install zlib libglib-dev python-setuptools quilt libssl-dev dwarfdump
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev pkg-config libglib2.0-dev binutils-dev libboost-all-dev autoconf libtool libssl-dev libpixman-1-dev libpython-dev python-pip python-capstone virtualenv
```

## Install toolchains / tools


```
$ scripts/install.sh
```

`scripts/install.sh` then installs all the rest necessary toolchains and tools.

# Static analysis

The Razzer's static analysis is based on the LLVM toolchain and the
SVF static analysis tool. See documents in `docs/static-analysis.md`.

# Fuzzing

Razzer's two-phases fuzzing is based on Syzkaller. The deterministic
scheduler is implemented using QEMU/KVM. See documents in
`docs/fuzzing.md`.
